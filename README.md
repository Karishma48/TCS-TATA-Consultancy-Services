It gives me great pleasure to introduce my latest creation, TCS TATA CONSULTANCY, which was meticulously created with Power BI. 

Three pages make up this project, and they offer helpful insights: 

Sheet 1: Overview of the Market 

shows the Tata Open Price, Tata Close Price, Tata High Price, and Tata Low Price along with the dashboard's current status. 
contains two charts that show the summary of the market. 
Sheet 2: Analysis of Stocks 

includes a line graph that displays the TCS stock values for the current day, month, year, and quarter. 
Data Table 
gives a table with all the information utilized in it.
